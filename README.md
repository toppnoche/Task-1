# Clustering of text data

In this repo we used various clustering and topic modeling algos to generate various clusters afters preprocessing the data


## Documentation

The dataset had 1739754 rows and 5 columns.      
We preprocessed the data to reduce to 77532 rows.

After preprocessing we applied varous embedding to convert the text into numbers

     1)TF-IDF
     2)Word2Vec
     3)Universal Sentence Encoder
     4)Bert embeddings
     5)Doc2Vec
And also applied topic modeling

     1)Bertopic
     2)Top2Vec
     3)LDA
and formed different clusters with different embeddings and visualied them.
